# Speedupy

## Introduction
To run any file of this repository, run the command `<python version> <file name> <arguments> -v <version>` int the terminal. For this experiment we will be using the version `v027x`, so, in my machine, one example of terminal command is:
```
python3 fibonacci_iterative.py 10 -v v027x
```

## Serialization
To first goal of this group is to implement differents methods of serialization. Originally, the speedupy runs with pickle by default. Apart from that, we will test the simplejson, pickejson and hdf5 methods of serializarion.
